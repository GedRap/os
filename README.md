# My Little Operating System

An Operating System from ground up for AVR/Arduino. Aiming to create a
platform which could be used to develop embedded systems and, of course,
to learn a lot while working on it.

Features I am aiming to implement by March 2014: multitasking, events based
I/O system, resource management, and very simple user interface.

This is part of my final year project at University of Manchester, UK.
