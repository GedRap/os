# GedOS v0.1

## Introduction

An Operating System from ground up for AVR/Arduino. Aiming to create a
platform which could be used to develop embedded systems and, of course,
to learn a lot while working on it.

This is part of my final year project at University of Manchester, UK.

## Arduino Integration

This repository hosts Vanilla version of the project. Arduino integration is built on top of Vanilla version and includes Arduino header files, and other specifics. It will be posted soon.
